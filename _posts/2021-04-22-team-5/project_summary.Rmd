# Problem Statement

 The problem this project will address is the decision almost to pursue higher education i.e. anything post-high-school. This problem will not only focus not only on wether the person decides to pursue higher education, but also what type of higher education they want to pursue e.g. private university, communitty college, trade school, etc.

- There are a number of factors that can influence a person's decision regarding higher education such as peer pressure, lack of knowledge, and societal factors like income inequality and family circumstances.

- The decision to go to college or not affects the majority of people from wealthy to low-income individuals and has a significant impact not only on those individuals’ lives but also on the welfare of the society as a whole i.e.  effective use of resources, better economy.

# User Interviews

### Interview 1 Lana Oeun, College Drop-out

- 31 March 2021
- In high school, Lena planned to attend college because that was what everyone wanted her to do, and what her parents wanted for her. However, throughout her first year at college, she realized that going to college was not financially feasible for her and dropped out. Lena believes that other endeavors will better help her achieve her goal of being financially independent. 

### Interview 2 Admissions Officer (Name Witheld for Privacy)

- 5 April 2021
- The admissions officer believed that some sort of higher education should be everyone's goal, but it doesn't have to be a 4-year university. She described the admissions system as focused on what the student will bring to the community on campus and not on what the student's life will be like after college. She also noted that there is much more to addmissions' and student's decisions regarding college other than finances.

### Interview 3 - Anuj Patel, Junior in High School

- 9 April 2021
- Anuj went to a public high school but was always very good in school. He experienced pressure from his family to go to college. It was a very traditional story where he was very much expected to go to college as this was the next step for his career and his family was willing to help pay for it. 
 
### Interview 4 - Sahi Patel, Parent of a High School Student

- 9 April 2021
- Sahi is a doctor who clearly had a large emphasis on education and would not allow their child to not attend college. Her view was that all parents should want their child to get as much education as possible as this is the foundation for success. She and her husband have saved up to pay for their child's higher education since they know it can be quite expensive. 
    

# Learnings from the User Interviews

### Learning 1

- There are a number of intangible factors that play a roll in the decision as tot whetther students should go to college e.g. building networks, personal fullfillment.

### Tweak 1

- Intangible factors in college enrollment such as network can not be quantified easily in a product, so we decided to focus on a quantitative financial approach in providing value through our product.

### Learning 2 

- College admissions do not take into account what happens to students post-college whether in regard to finances or career choices.

### Tweak 2

- Therefore, it is truly up to students to look out for their personal interests in relation to post-graduate life. The decision they will make needs to be an informed decision so that they know what they are signing up for if they choose to pursue higher education.

### Learning 3

- Some students are unaware of all options avalable to them when graduating high school.

### Tweak 3

- Thus, we wanted our solution to provide a clear list of options and make it easy to compare and contrast them using some sandardized metrics.

# Storyboarding a Solution

## Frame 1

- Billy is a junior in high school. 
- He comes from a low-income family and his parents own a small business.

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83670292/117216225-6c314000-adcd-11eb-8111-56c45801d913.png)

## Frame 2

- Many of Billy’s friends are going to college or have some plans for after graduation, so Billy wants to consider his options.

![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83670292/117216267-7c491f80-adcd-11eb-9108-371602628d05.png)

## Frame 3

- He googles some keywords online and finds our website. He starts the questionnaire.

![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83670292/117216327-8ff48600-adcd-11eb-8a40-87f833a2e29d.png)

## Frame 4

- He starts the questionnaire in order to see what his options are and what is the best choice for him given everything.

![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83670292/117216349-9aaf1b00-adcd-11eb-9c8e-dbedf5d41887.png)

## Frame 5

- First question is how much can you/family contribute to your education. Billy’s family cannot spare any money for him to study further. 
- This means he will need to either take out loans or look for scholarships/financial aid for further education.

![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83670292/117216422-bc100700-adcd-11eb-868c-c9d8ee381e35.png)

## Frame 6

- Second question is about his/his family’s overall income. 
- Billy’s family is low-income so he will be able to get public loans if he decides to go to college.

![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83670292/117216432-c0d4bb00-adcd-11eb-90b5-84fe9011e603.png)

## Frame 7

- Third question is about grades (good/average/poor student with numbers). 
- Billy is an average student so he is not very likely to get merit based scholarships but could possibly get need-based aid (however also unlikely since schools that are need-blind are usually highly-selective).

![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83670292/117216439-c4684200-adcd-11eb-9df9-0b309661a945.png)

## Frame 8

- Fourth question is about interests and majors: checkbox the top 3 answers. 
- Billy is interested in engineering majors,likes music, and finally education.

## Frame 9

- There are options for each major picked ranked best to worst (e.g. instate/out of state).
-  Billy can click on any of the given options to see more details about financial and employment information for each option.

## Frame 10

- Billy used the results from the questionnaire and decided to do community college part time studying engineering. 
- He was able to help his parents and now has a good job.

# Next Steps

- Gather much more data about the broader spectrum of needs for students. 
- Get software team to build application and conduct user tests to see what we can change about the app to make it more tailored.
- Try to incorporate more intangible factors that we currently omit because they would be hard to implement.
