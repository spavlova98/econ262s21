# Problem Statement

 The problem this project will address is the decision almost to pursue higher education i.e. anything post-high-school. This problem will not only focus not only on wether the person decides to pursue higher education, but also what type of higher education they want to pursue e.g. private university, communitty college, trade school, etc.

- There are a number of factors that can influence a person's decision regarding higher education such as peer pressure, lack of knowledge, and societal factors like income inequality and family circumstances.

- The decision to go to college or not affects the majority of people from wealthy to low-income individuals and has a significant impact not only on those individuals’ lives but also on the welfare of the society as a whole i.e.  effective use of resources, better economy.
